# JTV Auto Detailing App

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to make a full stack app using tools learned from this SEI. The backend was created with Express, Sequelize, and Postgres. The frontend was made with React. Different dependencies were loaded to assit in data flow. Styling of the app was a mixture of Bootstrap, Material UI, and traditional css.
